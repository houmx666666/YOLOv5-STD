   The yolov5-STD is developed for small targets detection desgined by Dr. Mingxin Hou.
   Compared with YOLOv5 anchor frames, YOLOv5-STD has an extra set of small selection boxes, which is sensitive to small objects in fish processing factories images.The improved models can be found in "models" folder.
   The code of the YOLOv5-STD algorithms have been trained and tested using Windows 64-bit professional edition with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti (12G) GPU and an Intel Xeon 5218R CPU.The images object detection program was developed in pytorch1.7.
   Structure of YOLOv5-STD ia as follows:
